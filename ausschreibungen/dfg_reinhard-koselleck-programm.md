Interdisciplinary Projects under the Reinhart Koselleck Programme

Short description: Interdisciplinary research is often particularly challenging and requires special efforts at newly emerging interfaces. In order to create an additional opportunity for interdisciplinary research and to make the achievements of scientists who conduct research at scientific boundaries more visible, the DFG launches an open call under the Reinhart Koselleck programme. The aim is to enable outstanding researchers with a proven scientific track record to pursue exceptionally interdisciplinary and innovative projects. Research proposals from all scientific disciplines dedicated to all research topics can be submitted that pursue an interdisciplinary approach. Proposals should meet the criteria of the Reinhart Koselleck programme described in the guidelines (DFG form 1.18). The most relevant requirements for proposals are a high degree of innovation and a high risk due to the interdisciplinary orientation of the research project. These aspects are central funding criteria in the review process and are going to be carefully considered. Applicants are thus asked to highlight the interdisciplinary nature of the proposed research as well as the related risks and their mitigation. Beside single applicant proposals, tandem proposals from two applicants are invited. The innovative and interdisciplinary character of the combination of the applicants’ expertise and their cooperation is accordingly a highly relevant criteria in the review process.
