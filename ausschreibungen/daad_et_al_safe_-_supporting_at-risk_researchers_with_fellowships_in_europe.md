## DAAD et al.: SAFE - Supporting At-risk researchers with Fellowships in Europe

* Nächste Einreichung: 2024-12-09
* Institution: DAAD

The SAFE project aims to provide fellowships to researchers at risk. Researchers at risk within the scope of the call include doctoral and post-doctoral researchers who face threats to their life, personal freedom, or research career, or who have been forced to flee because of such threats. The available SAFE fellowships will be awarded to researchers without EU citizenship who may be currently outside the EU or who are already in an EU Member State.
SAFE fellowships are awarded for a minimum of 12 months up to 24 months. Fellowships must end no later than August 2027. Applications from all domains of research and innovation are welcome. 

Uni Leipzig: As applicant institutions may submit only one application on behalf of one researcher, an internal selection process will be necessary. Hence interested researchers are requested to reveal their intention to participate by 9 December 2024 to gerhard.fuchs@zv.uni-leipzig.de.
