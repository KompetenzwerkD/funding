* Nächste Einreichung: 2021-07-31
* Institution: Max-Planck-Gesellschaft

The Max Planck Institute for the History of Science, Berlin - Department III, Artifacts, Action, Knowledge - offers several Visiting Scholarships (residential, 3–12 months) to take place in the period January 1 to December 31, 2021. It invites scholars to apply for participation in the project “Agriculture and the Making of Sciences (1100–1700)” of Department III. In 2021, the project’s focus will be on the broader theme of “soil.” It welcomes researchers working on practices related to soil, such as its classification, fertilization, maintenance, and commodification, as well as how these practices were in relation to fields of knowledge and practices other than agriculture, in the history of East and Southeast Asia, Inner Asia and the Middle East and North Africa.

It welcomes applications from candidates in every field within history, the history of science and technology, archeology, philology and art history, and with some preference for research addressing the multilingual and transregional nature of the project.
