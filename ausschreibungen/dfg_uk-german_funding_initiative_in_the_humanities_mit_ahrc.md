* Nächste Einreichung: 2022-02-22
* Institution: DFG, AHRC

Short description:The Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC) and the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) are launching a call for proposals for outstanding joint UK-German research projects in the Humanities. Proposals may be submitted in any area of the Humanities, as defined in the research funding guides. Projects must have well-defined joint working programmes, clearly demonstrating the added value of UK-German collaboration. Immediate resubmission of unsuccessful proposals from one call under the AHRC-DFG Memorandum of Understanding to the next call is not permitted but is acceptable for future calls. Applicants unsuccessful under the last call may submit different proposals for this call.
