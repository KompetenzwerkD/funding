## DFG: UK-German Funding Initiative in the Humanities (mit AHRC)

* Nächste Einreichung: 2024-02-20
* Institution: DFG, AHRC

The Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC), part of UK Research and Innovation (UKRI), and the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) are launching a call for proposals for outstanding joint UK-German research projects in the Humanities. Both funding agencies want to strengthen international cooperation in the fields of Arts and Humanities to fund academic research of the highest quality within their own countries. The scheme will provide funding for integrated UK-German projects. The partner agencies will organise a coordinated peer review and a single joint selection process. Funding will be distributed among the research partners according to scholars’ place of work and, more generally, according to the funding rules of each individual agency. The duration of the projects will normally be – and must not exceed – three years. Successful projects will be expected to start in early 2025.
