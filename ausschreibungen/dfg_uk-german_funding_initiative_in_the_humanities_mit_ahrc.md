## DFG: UK-German Funding Initiative in the Humanities (mit AHRC)

* Nächste Einreichung: 2023-02-15
* Institution: DFG, AHRC

Short description: The AHRC) and the DFG are launching a call for proposals for outstanding joint UK-German research projects in the Humanities. Proposals should strengthen cooperation in the fields of arts and humanities between Germany and the UK. Both funding agencies want to strengthen international cooperation in these fields, to fund academic research of the highest quality within their own countries, and are aware that some of the best research can only be achieved by working with the best researchers internationally. The scheme will provide funding for integrated UK-German projects. The partner agencies will organise a coordinated peer review and a single joint selection process. Funding will be distributed among the research partners according to researchers’ place of work and, more generally, according to the funding rules of each individual agency. Projects must have well-defined joint working programmes, clearly demonstrating the added value of UK-German collaboration. We expect that each partner substantially contributes to the common project; this also includes taking on organisational responsibilities.
