* Nächste Einreichung: 2021-05-07
* Institution: EU

The present transnational call in the humanities and social sciences will support new and innovative research into the workings, meaning and consequences of transformations and innovations in the present digital age, viewed through the lens of the social and cultural dynamics (Topic 1: Cultural Transformations in the Digital Age, Topic 2: Digitalisation and Social Transformation).

Teams of at least 4 Principal Investigators from 4 or more different countries participating in the call can apply for 1 500 000 EUR for a project duration of 24 to 36 months.

Whilst the call text does not preclude comparison with or investigation into other regions, every proposal must demonstrate a strong European dimension (i.e. investigating the changes taking place / affecting Europe as a whole, or at the level of a European country, city, community, etc.).
