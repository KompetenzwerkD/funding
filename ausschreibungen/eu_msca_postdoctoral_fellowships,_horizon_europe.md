The goal of MSCA Postdoctoral Fellowships is to enhance the creative and innovative potential of researchers holding a PhD and who wish to acquire new skills through advanced training, international, inter-sectoral and interdisciplinary mobility. Eligible applicants must have completed their PhD by 11th September 2024, have up to 8 years of research experience after the award of the PhD and comply with the MSCA PF mobility rules. (1) European Fellowships: These fellowships take place in an EU Member State or Horizon Europe Associated Country and can last between 1 and 2 years. Researchers of any nationality can apply. 

(2) Global Fellowships: The fellowship lasts 2 to 3 years, of which the first 1 to 2 years will be spent in a non-associated Third Country, followed by a mandatory return phase of 1 year to an organization based in an EU Member State or Horizon Europe Associated Country. 

Wichtig: Prüfen, ob es an Forschungseinrichtungen/Hochschulen bestehende Kooperationen gibt! Dann gibt es ggf. Sonderregelungen beim Austausch.
