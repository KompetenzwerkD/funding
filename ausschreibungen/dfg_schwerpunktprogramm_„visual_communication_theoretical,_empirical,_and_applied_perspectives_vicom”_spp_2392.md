## DFG: Schwerpunktprogramm „Visual communication. Theoretical, empirical, and applied perspectives (ViCom)” (SPP 2392)

* Nächste Einreichung: 2025-03-31
* Institution: DFG

The overall goal of ViCom is to investigate the special features and linguistic significance of different components of visual communication.
Central fields of interest are (1) sign languages as fully developed natural languages exclusively using the visual modality and (2) visual means that interact with and enhance spoken and written language such as co-speech gestures and emojis. With a strong focus on developing linguistic theory, ViCom strives to bring together different research foci and the joint expertise of communities which usually work on similar research objects, but without a great deal of interaction.
