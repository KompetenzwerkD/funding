* Institution: DFG

DFG: Emmy Noether Programme

Dreaming of a university teaching career? Planning to continue your academic career in Germany even after your funding comes to an end? Through its Emmy Noether Programme, the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) helps outstanding young researchers in all subject areas qualify as professors - without the need for the usual postdoctoral thesis qualification ("Habilitation" in Germany): stipend-holders head their own research group and assume teaching duties.

Deadline: 4 years after PhD (prolongation for child care related breaks)

Applications can be submitted at any time.
