## DFG: Open Research Area for the Social Sciences

* Nächste Einreichung: 2021-11-17
* Institution: DFG

The seventh round of the Open Research Area (ORA) is based on an agreement between the Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR, France), the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, Germany), the Economic and Social Research Council of UK Research and Innovation (ESRC, UK), and the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC, Canada). In order to strengthen international cooperation in the field of social sciences, wishing to fund high quality scientific research within their own countries, and aware that some of the best research can be delivered by working with the best researchers internationally, ANR, DFG, ESRC, and SSHRC are launching a seventh ORA call for proposals to fund the best joint research projects in the social sciences. The scheme will provide funding for integrated projects by researchers coming from at least three of the four subscribing countries – in any combination of three or four countries. There is again a special opportunity for cooperation with projects in Japan. With the aim to strengthen cooperation between researchers in Japan and ORA partners, the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS), as the national funding organisation of Japan, renews the funding scheme to support projects, which are associated with ORA.
