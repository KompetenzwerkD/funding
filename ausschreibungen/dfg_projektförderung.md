DFG: Research Grants

Junior and senior researchers can realize a research project at a research institution in Germany. The program provides support in modular form: depending on the project, it is possible to apply for funding for your own position, for assistants' positions or for a visiting researcher. Applications can be submitted to the DFG at any time.
