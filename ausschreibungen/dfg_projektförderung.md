* Institution: DFG

DFG: Individual Research Grants / normale Projektförderung

Research grants enable individuals who have completed their academic training to conduct at any time research projects with clearly defined topics and durations, regardless of the subject. Researchers in Germany, or those working at a German research institution abroad, who have completed their academic training (a doctorate as a rule) are eligible to apply for DFG research grants. The maximum initial funding duration is three years. Subsequently, a renewal proposal may be submitted.
