The Azrieli Fellows Program has issued the Azrieli International Postdoctoral Fellowship Call for Applications for the 2022–23 academic year. The fellowship provides generous funding and support for international postdoc applicants to conduct research in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), the humanities and social sciences at eligible Israeli institutions. The value of the fellowship is approximately €48,000 (ILS 188,000) per year, including funds reserved for research and travel. Along with funding, the program offers unique opportunities for interdisciplinary and cross-cultural exchange, leadership training, community engagement, professional mentorship and a welcoming staff dedicated to the wellbeing of all Fellows.
