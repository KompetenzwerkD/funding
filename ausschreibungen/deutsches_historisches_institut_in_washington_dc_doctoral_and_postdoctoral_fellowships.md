## Deutsches Historisches Institut in Washington DC: Doctoral and Postdoctoral Fellowships

* Nächste Einreichung: 2022-04-01
* Institution: Deutsches Historisches Institut

The GHI awards short-term fellowships to European and North American doctoral students as well as postdoctoral scholars to pursue research projects that draw upon primary sources located in the United States. 

We are particularly interested in research projects that fit into the following fields: 

    German and European history

    The history of German-American relations

    The role of Germany and the USA in international relations

    American history (European doctoral and postdoctoral scholars only)

The proposed research projects should make use of historical methods and engage with the relevant historiography. We especially invite applications from doctoral students and postdoctoral scholars who currently have no funding from their home institutions. The fellowships are usually granted for periods of one to five months but, in exceptional cases and depending on the availability of funds, they can be extended by one month.
